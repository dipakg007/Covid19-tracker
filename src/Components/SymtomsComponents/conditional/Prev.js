          Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct
          you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the
          spread of viruses and other infections.

          Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing
          the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and
          should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow
          the advice provided by your local health authority.
